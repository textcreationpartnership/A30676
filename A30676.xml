            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Foreſee there may two or three queſtions ariſe upon this my undertaking, in which you may deſire ſatisfaction; the firſt may be, why I write at all? the ſecond, why I write on this ſubject? and the laſt, why I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix your Names to what I write? To theſe I ſhall anſwer in order: For the firſt, though I hope Gods glory and the publique good, be chiefly intended, yet my own ſatisfaction is alſo included; for I being ſet apart in my Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the work of the Miniſtry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated thereunto in my Ordination; and though I have but one talent, I would not have it wrapt in a napkin, when an account is required how I have employed it, leſt I be
<pb facs="tcp:40421:3"/> found ſpeechleſs, <hi>Aulaedus ſit, qui Citharaedus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe non poteſt,</hi> a man may be uſeful that is not excellent, and therefore I thought it my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty what howrs I could ſpare from my ſecular employments, ſhould be improved, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the good of ſouls: as for your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond demand, why I write upon this ſubject, ſeeing ſo many have gone before me, and what I do is but <hi>Alcinoo pomo dare,</hi> or in our Engliſh dialect, to light a candle when the ſun ſhines, <hi>or bring coals to Newcaſtle?</hi> to this I anſwer, if this leſſon be ſo well taught, it is a ſhame it is no better learnt: I fear there is not one of ten amongſt Chriſtians, but are guilty of the neglect of this profitable duty, which I ſuppoſe would bring the ſoul more real benefit, then many litigious controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about the modes and circumſtances of worſhip, about which many argue themſelves not only out of Charity, but out of their Chriſtianity, and loſe the ſubſtance, while they ſtrive about the ſhadow, and fill their heads with notions, rather then their hearts with graces: I conceive it is real communion with Chriſt, and the life of faith, that makes the ſoul fat and flouriſhing, and I think that meditation doth conduce as much to this as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duty whatſoever: prayer I know brings in ſupplys from heaven, and ſo doth this; and theſe two uſually are concomitant, and where the one is neglected, the other is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:40421:3"/> well performed: Meditation like the <hi>Bee</hi> fetches honey both from flowers and weeds, yea, this divine Alchymiſt extracts gold out of the courſeſt Mettles, and is the true Philoſophers ſtone that turns all into gold, and gold it ſelf into a ſpiritual ſubſtance; thoſe books which reduce religion into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice (which in our days lyes much in the theorick) and ſerve to reconcile the head and the heart, and maintain the vitals of religion, and the power of godlineſs, and further our great deſigne for heaven, ſhould be well ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of them I think <hi>ſtore is no ſore:</hi> By this heavenly art of divine meditation, wiſdome may be extracted out of folly, as <hi>Solomon</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtruction by beholding the field of the ſluggard, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24.30. &amp;c. and doubtleſs man was not plac't in the world as <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the Sea, to play therein; nor indowed with ſo many excellent faculties to be like bruit beaſts, only idle ſpectatours of the works of God; The uſe of reaſon doubtleſs was given for an higher end, to help us to view the Creator in the glaſs of the creature, and every thing lends a helping hand to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde in this work; There is no man ſo buſy if not ſinfully employed, but may finde ſome time every day to converſe with God, and now and then make a journey to heaven, and view thoſe Caeleſtial manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prepared for thoſe that love God; There
<pb facs="tcp:40421:4"/> is none ſo dull-witted, if honeſt hearted, but may learn ſome profitable leſſons in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſchool; the leaſt worm or gnat, or leaf of a tree, will point out God, to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant Chriſtian: That Meditation is a Chriſtian duty; none that pretend to religion or to reaſon it ſelf, will deny, and that to meditate upon Gods works as well as his word, is our duty, is evident; God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſends us to the oxe, and aſs, to learn our duty, <hi>Jſay.</hi> 1.3. ſometimes to fowls of heaven, the ſtork, the crane, and the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. ſometimes to the piſmire or ant, thoſe deſpicable inſects, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.6. <hi>and</hi> 30.25. and all to learn our duty; <hi>David</hi> learned humility by beholding the moon and the ſtars, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.3, 4. and Chriſt grounds many of his excellent ſermons upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occurrences that dayly fell out, as we ſee in the parable of the ſower and the ſeed, the tares of the field, and the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net caſt into the Sea, the leaven, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed, the fruitleſs figtree, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: what heavenly uſe doth he make of earthly things, and all this is for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that by this means we may of theſe earthly materials frame to our ſelves a <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs ladder</hi> to aſcend to heaven; for all thoſe viſibles will mount us up to beholde inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and give us a <hi>Piſgah</hi> ſight of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> even of thoſe things within
<pb facs="tcp:40421:4"/> the vail: And that ſoul that hath this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly art, can ſet it ſelf on work, and need not be idle or ill imployed, for time will fail us, and death ſurprize us, before we can have ſearched natures garden from end to end, or gathered hony from the ſeveral flowers: here we may walk at liberty, and crop what flowers we pleaſe, and no man is damnified thereby; in other reſpects our bounds are ſet, hitherto may we go and no further, but in this we have an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted circuit: <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> which hath ſet the world in a flame, hinders not in this caſe, the poor here hath as much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as the rich, and the ſervant as his maſter, for with the <hi>Bee</hi> we may ſuck ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from our neighbours fields and flowers, without his leave or licence, and feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his paſture without any dammage to him; 'Tis true in theſe my meditations I have contented my ſelf with a ſmall plot, and but ſeldome paſt the bounds of a garden or orchard, but had the publiſhing of it been deſigned at the firſt, I ſhould not have ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up my ſelf in ſo ſhort a lether, when the whole creation lay before me; The book of the creature ſtands open to us, and God may be read in every line of it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe why doth God diſcover to us the ſtate of the fallen angels, and of the rich glutton, and the ſtate of the damned, if no
<pb facs="tcp:40421:5"/> profitable uſe could be made of it: no place is ſo barren as a barren heart, each dead tree will yield ſome fruit to us, if the ſoul be not dead: I have pluckt here and there a flower, as others have done before me, and he that comes after us may finde as good as any we have gotten: Thoſe I have gathered are rather to comfort the heart, then to pleaſe the fancy, rather to benefit the ſoul with their vertue, then to pleaſe the eye with their beauty; their nature (if I miſtake them not) is to draw the heart and affections to God, and cool and deadden it to the world and ſin; But a gracious heart is then required to make the extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for if it be mixt with the dregs of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy it will prove uſeleſs: The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite like a puppet in a play, may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit mans ſhape and geſtures, yea, like a parrat his voice, when he underſtands not what he ſaith or doth, yea, ſuch a one mars all he ſets his hands to; but a good man hath an holy heart, as well as a holy tongue, and this will prove a ſoul-ſatting Ordinance to ſuch a man; this will raiſe up the heart to hoaven, which is one of our ſureſt evidences for heaven; If any yet pleade, there are too many books on this ſubject extant already, the more ſhame for us then that the duty is ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that is not ſufficiently taught, that
<pb facs="tcp:40421:5"/> is not ſufficiently learnt, and I fear thoſe that are readieſt to make the objection, are not the moſt conſcientious in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duty: There are many that make conſcience of morning and evening prayers in their families, that ſpend little time in this duty; if any quarrel at the language theſe meditations ſpeak, let them know, my deſigne is, to make men live bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not to make them ſpeak better; if they ſpeak the language of <hi>Canaan</hi> they will be underſtood by true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and will be owned by thoſe that had rather be fed then flattered; it is a diſtempered ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack that muſt be fed with kickſhaws, truth looks beſt in the plaineſt dreſs, and a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond needs no painting, <hi>via trita eſt via tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and plain ſence is the beſt orthography of an honeſt heart. In ſhort, the reaſon why I write upon this ſubject is, not to pleaſe mens humours, or ſatisfy ſqueaſy ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, but becauſe I judge this to be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, though much neglected duty, and therefore moſt neceſſary to be treated of.</p>
            <p>As for the laſt of your demands, why I prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix your names to it, I think there are none that knows both you and me, and my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to you, that need ſtumble at it; but I ſhall anſwer it, firſt negatively, and then affirmatively, I do it not, becauſe I think you have more need of it then
<pb facs="tcp:40421:6"/> others, for I know but few better able then you to gather ſuch flowers as theſe for your ſelves; But it is, becauſe I think you are better able to judge of it then moſt are, and if you think I have not miſt my way, I care not much what thoſe ſay, that never travailed in this road: I ſpeak to thoſe that underſtand the language, for to others, haply I may ſeem a barbarian: A hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may pretend to the language, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it not, he ſpoils this as well as all his other duties; I preſent this firſt to you, for if it paſs this text, I matter not much what many others ſay of it; And alſo that thereby I may tell the world, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then you, what my thoughts are of you, and to point them out a pattern for their imitation; for I verily believe, and I think upon ſerious obſervation, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral branches of both your families, do maintain the vitals of religion, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er of godlineſs in as eminent a manner, as any family of your rank that I know in the Nation, and keep themſelves as unſpotted in the world, and as free from the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſes of the times: And he that is the ſearcher of all hearts, knows, I ſpeak my thoughts without flattery or fauning, and I do it for no ſiniſter end: but (as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> did commend the good huſwife, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.29. that God may be glorifyed for his
<pb facs="tcp:40421:6"/> bounty to you, and your hands may be ſtrengthned in well doing, and others may take example by you, and your lives may be for their imitation. I cannot praiſe my preſent any further, then from the truth of the heart that ſends it; had it been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it had been ſent with a better will: I ſend it as a poor man doth a preſent to his ſuperiour, not to ſupply his wants, but to manifeſt his love, thankfulneſs and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him; or as a debtor to his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, who when he cannot pay the debt, pays the intereſt, or at leaſt teſtifyes his willingneſs, if ability be wanting: What I have done in this my undertaking, I judged to be my duty; <hi>David</hi> bids us, <hi>commune with our own hearts, Pſal.</hi> 4.4. and he calls upon others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>come and hear all ye that fear the Lord, and I will declare what he hath done for my ſoul:</hi> I have not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to think, that this or any thing I can do can paſs the teſt of this critical age, or indeed can contribute much to the adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſpouſe of Chriſt, I know a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of goats-hair was not formerly rejected, neither will a cup of cold water where there is no better, nor two mites where there is no more, by him from whom I expect my reward: When you can write fairer then the Copy which will quickly be, you may lay it aſide, and give it to ſome one
<pb facs="tcp:40421:7"/> that cannot, for whoſe ſake it was chiefly written: but that it may prove beneficial both to you, and yours, and to the Church of God, for the advancing of the the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſs, and the life of religion, and the reſtoring this too much neglected duty of holy meditation, ſhall be, and is, the deſire and prayer of him, who is</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have here preſented thee with a bundle of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, moſt of them occaſional; I am not ſo conceited as to imagine there is any great excellency in them, nor ſo fooliſh to trouble my ſelf to write or others to reade them, did I judge them altogether uſeleſs; the duty I know is neceſſary and beneficiall, and many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans can write a <hi>probatum eſt</hi> upon it, and ſay it hath been ſo to them, however it is too much neglected by the moſt; I have not long ſince publiſhed ſome directions how to perform the ſeveral parts of Gods worſhip; amongſt the reſt this of meditation was one; and that which is ſet or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn was chiefly inſiſted upon, but that which is occaſional more briefly touch't, which indeed cannot well be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but is varied according as the time, place, object, and other circumſtances vary, and as the will or capacity of the perſon requireth, and therefore may be better taught by example then rule: This minded me of ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Meditations that had formerly warmed my heart, and not knowing but they might warm others alſo, and might be a means to reſtore this beneficiall though too much neglected duty, and therefore gathering together, and reveiwing my ſcattered papers, and making ſome additions, ſubſtractions, and alterations, I reduced them to the method here preſented: that it is every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians duty I think none will deny, and that it hath been the practice of believers is eaſy to prove: this was <hi>Iſaac's</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40421:8"/> practice, Gen. <hi>24.63.</hi> and it was <hi>Davids</hi> work, as the whole book of <hi>Pſalmes</hi> teſtify, ſee <hi>Pſal. 63.6.</hi> and <hi>77.12.</hi> and <hi>119.15.</hi> and <hi>143.5.</hi> and many other places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſee he meditated both on Gods word, and on his works, both by night and by day, and makes it the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a childe of God or a bleſſed man ſo to do, <hi>Pſal. 1.2.</hi> and a mark of one ripe for deſtruction not to regard the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, <hi>Pſal. 28.5.</hi> What I have here written is chiefly for thy imitation, and my deſire is that thou maiſt take out this leſſon, prove an artiſt, and ſet up for thy ſelf, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this gainfull trade that hath formerly brought ſo much glory to God, and ſo much profit to poor ſouls: The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod herein propounded is eaſy, and the duty to an honeſt heart not hard, yet remember it is the practick part that is like to do thee moſt good; here maiſt thou learn to ſpend thy time, and paſs away thy ſolitary hours better then moſt men do, for whether thou be at home, or abroad, in publick or in private; this duty may be in ſome meaſure performed, yea, by every man, in every place, in every company, and in every employment, though all places are not alike, a gracious heart can ſteal a thought into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and by a Meditation, and private ejaculation hold converſe wtth God, at any time, neither ſlave nor ſervant, though in a <hi>Turky</hi>-gally can be deprived of this liberty; The want of this heavenly art, or the not uſing of it is the cauſe of the miſpence of ſo much precious time, and that there are ſo many barren empty hearts as we dayly finde; for as the <hi>Bee</hi> gathers honey both from flowers and weeds, ſo doth a diligent man from every thing he ſees, hears of, or obſerves; time is ſuch a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous jewel, that it ſhould not be ſquandred away, and I know not well how it may be better improved then by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, for this ſpiritualizeth all we ſet or hear of; it makes a man never idle, nor ill employed, and drives on a rich trade for the ſoul, and either leads the ſoul to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb facs="tcp:40421:8"/> or brings heaven to it; I know meditation may be abuſed, ſome meditate how they may be rich, either by hook or by crook, the ambitious man how he may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, the voluptuous man how he may enjoy his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but a Chriſtian how he may enjoy his God, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his ſoul; ſome ſtudy miſchief upon their beds, ſome with the <hi>ſpiders</hi> gather poyſon, where the Chriſtian like the <hi>bee</hi> gathers honey, and the very buſineſs a Chriſtian is about will furniſh him with matter ſufficient for his work; if the heart be not barren every thing will be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and there is none ſo dull if not ſpiritually dead, but may gather ſomething from viſibles to minde him of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibles; No ſhip that ſails either to the Eaſt or Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> brings home richer lading then meditation doth, if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſteered; This is the chewing of the cud, that turns all to nouriſhment, the true Philoſophers ſtone that turns all to gold; by this means the ſpirits and quinteſcence of all earthly things are extracted; 'tis true of a Chriſtian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with his heavenly art, what the Poets feign of <hi>Midas,</hi> every thing they touch turns to gold, and gold it ſelf into a better ſubſtance; the hardeſt flint, the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tree, the moſt withering branch, or fading leaf, will yield good fruit to this artiſt, yea, better fruit then the gardens of the <hi>Heſperides,</hi> which are feigned to bear gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den apples, and every ſheep will bear a golden fleece, better then ever <hi>Jaſon</hi> fetcht from <hi>Colchis;</hi> By medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Chriſtian is carried into the third heaven, with <hi>Paul, whether in the body, or out of the body</hi> be ſcarcely knows, and there is enabled to ſee things inutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, this makes inviſible things viſible, and gives a man a <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſight of the heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> This hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly artiſt can with <hi>Daedalus</hi> make himſelf wings to fly aloft, and can break priſon at his pleaſure, neither need he fear the melting of the wax: This keeps the heart in order, and prevents its ſtrayings, it keeps vain thoughts from riſing, or at beſt from rooſting: There mans heart
<pb facs="tcp:40421:9"/> is like a mill, if it want griſt, it ſets it ſelf on fire, and if there be no corn to grinde for God, the devil will throw his tares into the hopper: The heart it always well or ill-employed, and will never be idle; holy meditation puts a man out of ſatans road, when otherwiſe he is in continuall danger of falling into his ſnares, or by being ſurprized by his wiles, when the idle perſon is commonly ſnared and taken; by this grace is ſtrengthened, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weakned, our evidences cleared, communion with God maintained, and acquaintance with our own hearts gained; it is the way to ſtore the underſtanding with knowledge, to ſubject the will to Gods will, to warm the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffections, and to put life and heat into all our duties; this diſcovers to us the ſinfulneſs of ſin, and vanity of the creatures, and the fulneſs of Chriſt; this reacheth out to us ſome of <hi>Canaans</hi> grapes, ſome <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſights of glory, even of thoſe things within the veil, and a taſte of thoſe pleaſures which are at the right hand of God; ſuch a taſte as this, made <hi>Moſes</hi> deſpiſe the pleaſures of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> court, and <hi>Galeacius</hi> eſteem all the wealth in the world not worth one days communion with God; this lets us ſee, there is a worm of vanity bred in our cheifeſt earthly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and eats out the very heart of them, and if they are abuſed, they will breed and feed the worm that never dies, and kindle that fire that never ſhall go out; Theſe and a thouſand ſuch leſſons meditation will teach us, and faſtens every leſſon upon the heart; who then would not follow ſo gainfal a trade, and practice ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a calling? Did it enrich the body as it doth the ſoul, we ſhould have many proficients in this School; ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders there are to this duty, but they rather pretend then intend it, they throw down the hammer before they have driven the nail to the head, and lay down the premiſes, but ſtay not to raiſe the concluſion; they follow not the work till they come to reſolution and practice; they are like a man that ſtrikes fire, gathers wood, but leaves off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:40421:9"/> it be kindled, and ſo all his labour is loſt; This duty enables a man with <hi>Paul</hi> to die dayly, and with <hi>Stephen</hi> to ſee God, with <hi>Moſes</hi> to talk with God, and with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> to walk with God; It fits a Miniſter to preach, and the people to hear, neither of which can be well done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; that ſermon that is not well ſet on by meditations, ſeldom heats the preachers heart, and then the people ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom feel it, for a dull and drowſy preacher, makes a dull and ſleepy people; when the miniſter preaches his own life and experiences, this is the life of preaching; This <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is a ſerious bending of the minde upon ſome uſeful ſubject till we bring it to ſome profitable iſſue;</hi> Occaſionall meditation (which is it we now treat of) ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from ſome occaſionall object preſented to our ſences or underſtanding, by divine providence, of which though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples may be given, yet hardly can it be reſtrained, or brought under rules, for it may be varied according to the variety of the objects preſented, or other accidents, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, or circumſtances that offer themſelvs, or the will of the perſon, or his ability; the objects that offer themſelves are various and innumerable, for there is nothing <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum natura,</hi> but may be a fit object for occaſional medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; God hath given us a large field to walk in, and choiſe of flowers, pluck what we will, to put into our noſe-gay; we may gather honey from flowers and weeds, out of our own or neighbours fields without offence; which way ſoever we look, within us, or without us, above us, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us, before us, or behinde us, or on either ſide, we may ſee ſuitable matter for our meditation; above us we may ſee the ſun, moon and ſtars, thoſe glorious lamps of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who offer themſelves not only to our view, but alſo to our contemplation, their light, their heat, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, their various though unerring motions, their magnitude, altitude, number, nature, ſplendor, vertue and effects may breed admiration in us, as well as in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal. 8.3, 4. and 19.1.</hi> or ſhould we deſcend to
<pb facs="tcp:40421:10"/> ſublunary things, to the fiery or ayery regions, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſeveral meteors in both, that preſent themſelves to our view, we may finde matter not only for meditation, but alſo for admiration; if we conſider a while the winde, the ſnow, the rain, the froſt, the ice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all brought out of Gods treaſury, <hi>Pſal. 135.7.</hi> the thunder, and lightning with their ſtrange effects, the ſtrange appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions often ſeen in the air, comets, blazing-ſtars, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, fire-drakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> armies fighting in the air, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bears, horſes, and many other things there reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, raining bloud, wheat, frogs, ſtones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all this may raiſe our admiration; veiw but the rain bow in its ſhape and various colours; it deſerves our conſideration; The powerful influence of theſe ſuperiour bodies, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling, and retaining thoſe hugh weighty and towring clouds, thoſe bottles of heaven in the open air, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the earth with them at their makers pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which neither man nor beaſt could ſubſiſt; who can view thoſe things without conſideration? or if we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth out of which we were taken, we may finde matter enough to exerciſe our thoughts; obſerve this huge and maſſy globe hanging in the air upon nothing; conſider it as it is diſtinguiſhed into hills and dales, and woods and forreſts, adorned with ſumptuous buildings, Towns and Caſtles, abounding with trees of all ſorts, with corn and graſs, with herbs and flowers, watered with rain and ſhowers, rivers, ſprings, and fountains, inhabited with a thouſand times ten thouſand living creatures of all ſorts, men and beaſts, fowls, and creeping things, all main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the great houſholders charge, who preſerves them in their ſeveral kindes; conſider alſo the perenity of rivers, the cauſe, and perpetuity of ſprings of all ſorts, ſome hot, ſome cold, ſome ſweet, ſome bitter, ſome ſalt, ſome freſh, ſome medicinal, ſome not, this obſervation may take up ſome time: or ſhould we conſider the ſeveral mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals lodged in the concaves of the earth, as of gold, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb facs="tcp:40421:10"/> braſs, tin, iron, lead, allom, brimſtone, coals, lime, ſtone, and much more, and how uſeful and neceſſary theſe are to human life; This may teach us many profitable leſſons: Or ſhould we go to ſea to ſee the wonders of the deep, and obſerve how the huge and roaring element is reſtrained and bounded by an almighty arm, that ſaith, <hi>hitherto ſhalt thou go and no further;</hi> or if we conſider the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of it, a wonder in nature, or the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs number of living creatures therein, which are fed and cheriſhed by thoſe ſalt and brackiſh waters, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ſweetneſs, or if we conſider the cauſe why thoſe waters alone are ſalt, and ſo remain, though a thouſand freſh rivers dayly run into it, together with their ſtrange creatures therein produced: theſe conſiderations will take up much time, but of all the creatures God hath made, none yield more matter for meditation, then angels and men; Angels, both the good and the bad, their nature, eſſence, and offices, and man conſidered in his body and ſoul, the order, uſe, comlineſs and proportion of the ſeveral parts, the vegetative, ſenſitive, and rational faculties of the ſoul, the underſtanding, will and affections, the memory, conſcience, and many more, the ſeveral ſences whereby the ſoul comes to underſtand things here below, theſe things deſerve conſideration; but to let paſs the works of creation, and conſider a while Gods works of providence, theſe will take up much of our time; we may ſee and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the courſe of nature, the generation and production of the ſeveral <hi>ſpecies,</hi> with their preſervation, protection, and the proviſion made for them, by their Creator; he maintains the ſeveral <hi>ſpecies</hi> by his providence, that for ought we know there is not one kinde of them extinct ſince the creation; nay, the power of man was never able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe kindes that are noxious to man, and therefore hated by him; yet are theſe maintained by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at his own coſt and charges; But his providence is more clearly ſeen and diſcovered in his providence to man,
<pb facs="tcp:40421:11"/> eſpecially to his own Church, in maintaining a handfull of men againſt their numerous enemies; theſe are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as lambs amongſt wolves, and is the <hi>buſh</hi> that is ever burning, yet never conſumed: he ſpred a table for them in the wilderneſs, in diſpight of their enemies; the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence of God for his Church in all ages, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-times, and down to this day, may fir us with much matter for meditation: The word of God alſo as well as his works may yield much matter for contemplation; it furniſhed <hi>David</hi> for meditation day and night, every Book, every Chapter, yea every verſe is fruitful abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that had we the years of <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> the time would be too little to run through the Scripture, and to conſider of all that is held forth therein; here are precepts and promiſes, threats and examples, for our good, here is the great work of our redemption treated of, which the angels deſire to pry into, and eternity is little enough to admire: herein we may behold the ſubtilty of Satan in tempting man, mans frailty in yielding to the temptation, the nature of ſin in throwing man out of paradice, and angels out of heaven; the wiſdome of God in finding out a remedy to ſave ſome, the love of Chriſt in dying for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay by meditation we have liberty to aſcend heaven alſo, and veiw thoſe caeleſtial manſions prepared for thoſe that love and fear God; but I ſhall add no more, leſt I make the gate too big for the ſtructure, only this is my deſire, and ſhall be my prayer, that it may tend to Gods glory, and his Churches good, and ſo I reſt,</p>

               <p>WAlking in the garden in the cool of the day, among other things that offered themſelves to my conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I obſerved my mother the <hi>Earth,</hi> whence I had my original, and out of whoſe womb I had my being: I conſidered how near of kin I was to thoſe ſenceleſs clods that lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my feet, and that I was made of the ſame matter, a little more refined, and moulded up in a better form, and was made by God a little walking breathing clay, and ſhortly muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my firſt matter, <hi>for duſt thou art</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and unto duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> Theſe and the like thoughts had a various operation upon my ſoul; ſometimes it put me on to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire

I who was even now proud that I was a man, began to vail my peacocks plumes, when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held my black feet, and to wonder at my own folly; and when I beheld my mother, and my relations, I ſaw there was ſmall cauſe of pride, and little cauſe to boaſt of birth or bloud, or great parentage or relations: 'tis a ſhame and ſin for an angel to be proud, much more for a dunghill-bird: Oh my ſoul! bleſs God, that thou waſt made a man, and not a clod of clay, a rationall creature, and not a brute beaſt; thou waſt clay in the hands of this potter, and mighteſt have been the moſt deſpicable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever dropt from his fingers, but <hi>he hath made thee little lower then the Angels, and crowned thee with honour and dignity:</hi> what cauſe then haſt thou to admire thy Creator,

               <p>WAlking into the Garden as at other times, to take the ayr, I faſtened my eyes upon a green tuft of graſs that grew beſides me; the ſight of it brought to my remembrance what I had often heard and read, <hi>viz.</hi> that the damned in hell ſhould ſuffer exquiſite torments, ſuch as the tongue of men or angels are not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and that for as many millions of years as there are graſs-piles upon the earth, ſands on the ſea ſhoar, ſtars in heaven, and motes in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40421:16"/> the Sun; and yet after all this long tract of time their torments ſhall be no nearer to an end nor they to a delivery, then they were the firſt day they were caſt in; This made me a little to conſider the number of piles that was in this little tuft, and when I found it too hard for me to number them, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what was this tuft to one paſture, or that to one Pariſh, or that to one County, or that to one Kingdome, or that to the whole world: this made me to cry out, Oh Eternity, Eternity! who can conceive of thee? who can fathom thee? Oh the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature of ſin that provokes a mercifull God to lay ſuch heavy ſtrokes upon his poor creatures! Oh the love and pains of our dear Redeemer! what did he ſuffer to quench thoſe flames, and diſcharge thoſe debts for his people, in ſuffering what was due for their ſins? and oh the madneſs of men and my own folly, that knowing there is ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs gulf before us, run on ſo madly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and that for momentary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, deceitfull riches, worthleſs honour, or filthy ſin, do venture the ſoul upon the pikes of danger: Oh the miſery of poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate wretches! what will you do in the latter end? <hi>who amongſt us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? who amongst us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burning?</hi> Eſay. 33.14. <hi>Tophet is prepared of old, even for the King it is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40421:17"/> prepared, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord like a river of brimſtone doth kindle it,</hi> Eſaiah 30.33. Were a man compelled to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a feather bed but one year without turning or ſtirring, though other comforts were afforded, how painful, how tedious would that year ſeem? but what is this one year to eternity, or what is a featherbed to ſcalding lead, and burning brimſtone? or what is that to hell torments? Oh Satan! how doſt thou deceive us? Oh world! how doſt thou inſnare us? Oh ſin! how doſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch us? Oh heart! how doſt thou betray us to this deadly danger?

               <p>WHen I perceived one plot in my garden fruitful, and another barren, and obſerved the difference between the one and the other, how lovely, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, how pleaſant the fruitful plat ſeemed to me, how freſh and fragrant, how green and ardent it was, how it was diapred with various coloured flowers, beautiful and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40421:18"/> and how lothſome, unſeemly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome the other lookt, where nothing appeared but briars and thorns, weeds and thiſtles, with ſtones and rubbiſh, which was a fit receptacle for toads and ſerpents, and other venemous vermine; I began to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it was yet poſſible to reduce this plot into a better form, and turn it to a better uſe: And hereupon I cauſed the rubbiſh to be ſtockt up, the weeds to be pluckt up, and the ſtones pickt out, and after I digged and manured it, and had an effect anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my expectation; for when it was ſown with better ſeed, it brought forth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit: The unlovelineſſe of this plot when overgrown with weeds and rubbiſh, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this following Meditation: I thought it lively repreſented a heart barren of grace and goodneſſe, but fruitfull of briars and thorns, ſin and wickedneſſe, which is more odious to God then this plot was to me, and yet how lovely a fruit bearing Chriſtian is in his eye, the one is like a loathſome muck-heap which ſtinks, the other like a watered garden that yields a ſweet favour, <hi>like a garden of ſpices,</hi> Cant. 4.14. the one brings forth fruit for Gods basket, the other fewell for the devils fire; all the ſeed ſown upon it is loſt, and choakt with briars and thorns, and all the rain that falls upon it doth but make the weeds more rank and flouriſhing: <hi>their grape

               <p>IN a dry ſeaſon, when the bottles of heaven were ſtopped, and the clouds were bound up, the rain reſtrained, and the ſhowers withheld from the earth, ſo that it was parched hard and dry, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in vain for cooling, moiſtning, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſoftning ſhowers; I obſerved ſome perſons when they could not get up the weeds by the roots, tare off their heads, which when they had done, the garden ſeemed pleaſant to the beholders, and gave content for a while to the ſpectators; who imagined there had been a through-refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but not long after, when a ſhower of rain diſtilled upon it, the cheat appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the weeds ſprung up as freſh and flouriſhing as before, yea, like <hi>hydra,</hi> with more heads then at firſt, ſo this partiall reformation was diſcovered: This obſervation afforded this Meditation, I thought it much reſembled a partiall refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the ſoul, when men begin their reformation at the wrong end, or take a wrong courſe to kill the tree of ſin, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, they crop and lop off ſome bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40421:30"/> and let the root alone, this is not the way to deſtroy it; many tear off ſome of the tops of the weeds but let the root re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſoul, which when it is watered with the devils temptations, and the worlds allurements, and animated with fit occaſions and ſuitable opportunities, they ſpring forth afreſh (it may be) with more heads then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and then the cheat appears, that thoſe ſins were not kil'd but laid aſide: An evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent example we have of this in <hi>Herod,</hi> who convinced by <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> preaching, that his courſes were not good, ſets upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, falls out with many of his ſins, lops off here one bough, and there another, but lets the root remain firm, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſpring forth and ſhew themſelves: It is ſaid, <hi>he reformed many things,</hi> but he left much work behinde undone, to the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſoul: The ſore was only skinned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and was not ſound at the bottom, and after broke out with more violence and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er anguiſh, like a torrent of water dam'd up; when the dam breaks, it runs more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly; So did <hi>Herods</hi> corruption, even to the taking away of <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> head, who before had ſet ſome ſtop to it: And thus it is with many ſeeming Converts, that after prove wicked apoſtates, and perſecute the truth that they did formerly profeſs, the root of the matter was not in them. <hi>Hazael</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:40421:31"/> did not believe ſo much wickedneſs to lodge in his heart, as the Prophet ſpake of, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appeared: An apple rotten at the heart may have a fair outſide, but the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within will in time rot the outſide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; when the fountain is corrupted, it is impoſſible to purge the ſtream: If the heart be rotten, all that thence proceeds will have an ill ſavour: This half reformation hath been the undoing of many forward Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in our days; they reformed their lives but not their hearts; they lopt off ſome boughs, but medled not with the root; they went to clenſe the ſtream, but not the fountain; and in a little time the corruption within, breaks forth into the life and converſation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and the unclean ſpirit that was caſt out, takes to himſelf ſeven more worſe then himſelf, and enters in, and <hi>the laſt end of that man is worſe then the beginning,</hi> Mat. 12.45. The devil deals by ſuch when he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, as a Jaylour with one that hath broke priſon, lays on more bolts: Runagate Chriſtians are the devils greateſt devotes, and ſuch apoſtates very hardly (if ever) are reduced: O my ſoul! how ſtands the caſe with thee? haſt thou not weeded thy own garden thus, and rather tore off the lops of the weeds then pluckt them up by the root? how comes it elſe to paſs that upon every ſhowr of temptation they are ſo apt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40421:31"/> to ſpring up again? look about thee if thou wilt not kill ſin, ſin will kill thee; and if thou wilt kill the curſed tree, ſtub it up by the roots, and not lop off here one branch, and there another, for if the root be dead, the branches will ſoon wither; but if the root live, the branches will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive: The way to cleanſe the ſtream, is to purge the fountain; for ſweet water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed from a ſtinking puddle: if the tree be good, the fruit will be good alſo; if the ſpring be not dried up, it will ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later overflow the dam: the way to cure the ſore is to heal it at the bottome; and heart-reformation is the beſt way to life-reformation: hypocriſie within will like a botch at length break forth, and a rotten heart will ere long rot the life alſo: O my God without thy aſſiſtance all my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will prove vain: the devil, the world, and my own deceitful heart will beguile me, let me not ſtrive in my own ſtrength, nor fail of thine aſſiſting grace; rather caſt me into the furnace, then ſuffer my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and droſs to remain in me; and rather plow deeper furrows by affliction, then ſuffer the roots of the weeds to remain in my heart: turn me, O Lord, and I ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; convert me, and I ſhall be converted; let me not take up with a partial reformation, and let nothing leſs then the death of ſin give me content.</p>

               <p>WHen I ſaw by experience how ſoon a neglected garden grows out of form and faſhion, and in a ſhort time comes to be a rude and indigeſted heap, grown over with weeds and nettles, traſh and rubbiſh, deſtroyed with moles, inhabited with toads, ſerpents, or other vermine, the wall broken down, the fence decayed, beaſts and ſwine making a prey of it, the one tearing off the tops, the other digging up the roots of the tender plants, the hearbs and flowers dying, withering or decaying, choaked by the weeds, or ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for want of nouriſhment, nothing flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth but weeds, and nothing appears but confuſion, and the whole appearing more like a wilderneſs, then a garden; This ſight brought to my minde the ſtate of the poor ſoul, when it is neglected, and not heedfully obſerved, then all run to ruine, and tends to confuſion, nothing that good is, proſpers; nothing that is bad, but flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth; corruption and ſin get the upper hand, and grace is kept under; the fence is let down, the watch is neglected, and the devil, <hi>that wilde boar of the forreſt, deſtroys the tender vines,</hi> roots up every good inclination, ſpoils every good motion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40421:34"/> and reſolution, and lays all waſte; how many have I known, who when they have been under good Maſters, good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, good Miniſters, have been very hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and towardly, and were likely to have made good inſtruments in the Church, for Gods glory, if not pillars in the houſe of God; while their graces, and good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were well watered and they received encouragement in their religious courſes; then the flowers of grace ſeemed to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and good deſires, holy intentions, and reſolutions, to bud forth, and hopeful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings ſhewed themſelves, and promiſing parts gave hopes of future encreaſe; But when theſe fire-ſticks, not well kindled, were once removed from thoſe that ſet them a burning, they were ſoon extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when they had changed their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their company, when they were left to themſelves, or to thoſe that were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of them, they went out of themſelves, and vaniſhed in a ſmoak, or in a ſnuff; then their corruptions ſoon gathered head, and their graces were at an under; they ſoon grew rude, and bruitiſh, and given to ſenſuality, and the hearb of grace for want of rain and nouriſhment, watering, and weeding, was ſoon ſuffocated by vice, and in ſhort time theſe men loſt that which they ſeemed to have, and their ſouls looked no

And on the other ſide, when the melting promiſes of the Goſpel are preſt; and God, and Chriſt, and heaven, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, everlaſting pleaſures, and treaſures, glory and happineſs is offered, this makes

               <p>FInding in the garden a heap of ants or piſmires, at the root of a tree, which I look't upon as no friends but enemies to an orchard, I diſturbed them with my foot, and they ſoon took the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, whereupon I took notice how theſe painful creatures behaved themſelves when thus diſturbed; they were all in a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome run this way, and ſome that, and no one knew where, or how to ſettle; and yet I obſerved every one laying hold of ſomething, and getting ſome burden upon his back, though he knew not where to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40421:43"/> bear it, I thought this confuſion reſembled a beſeiged City, when taken by the enemy, or the Countrey when an enemy makes an incurſion, the inhabitants every one ſhifts for himſelf, one runs this way, another that, to ſave himſelf, and if it may be to ſecure his chiefeſt Jewels, or that which he moſt values; this minded me by the way, that it was a Chriſtians wiſdome in all the incurſions of ſatan, and the inroads and aſſaults he makes upon us, to ſecure the ſoul our chiefeſt Jewel, and not leave it unguarded at his mercy: this is our fort-royall, which if taken we are undone, but if ſafe, though he take the out-works, it matters not much, if the caſtle be ſecure: Let us ſtore this therefore with proviſion, and ammunition, againſt the aſſaults of this treacherous enemy. Again, this confuſed ſtir that thus happened among theſe poor inſects, repreſented to me the hurlyburly that is abaoad in the world, wherein are millions of men; every one driving on ſome particular deſigne, and yet go vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways to work; ſome purſue after riches, ſome honours and ſome pleaſures, and yet agree not on the way, nor on the means to attain their end: Thoſe that aim at riches, all tread not in the ſame ſteps, ſome go a more plain way then others do, and by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourious toiling, carking, care and pains,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40421:43"/> ſeek to get it, and are no ones foes but their own, in ſpending ſo much time upon it, that they neglect their greater concerns; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by more ſubtill, but leſs honeſt ſhifts, caſt their ground, and think to take their prey before their neighbours; theſe by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cheating, ſwearing, forſwearing, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening, and circumventing, <hi>make haſt to be rich, but cannot be innocent:</hi> theſe ofttimes with the <hi>Eagle</hi> ſtealing meat from the altar, bring a coal with it, which fires their own neſts: ill-gotten goods ſeldome proſper, and the third heir ſeldome enjoys them; ſome in the purſuit of honour take the way of vertue, and hunt after it by deſert; but theſe are but few, yet this is the ſecureſt road: others endeavour to aſcend the ſteps of promotion by fawning, and flattery, and ſuch indirect courſes, but though theſe are the moſt by far, yet ofttimes they break their necks ere they come to the top of the ladder, and are always ſet in ſlippery places; the former way though leaſt trodden, and moſt painfull, is the ſureſt and ſafeſt; for honour follows virtue, as the ſhadow doth the ſubſtance: others that purſue pleaſure differ alſo, ſome ſeek after more innocent delights, others eſteem none worth enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but what is the forbidden fruit, and deſperatly purſue ſuch pleaſures, that periſh ere they are budded, <hi>and the end of that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40421:44"/> mirth is heavineſs.</hi> In a word, ſome are building caſtles in the air, and never live to finiſh them, others are getting goods, and know not who ſhall enjoy them; others are raking together by hook or by crook, and others are ſcattering abroad what is thus ſcraped together, and ſpend all, and know not who ſhall relieve them; ſome are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing themſelves content if they had a Lordſhip, others if they had a Dukedome, and ſome if they had a Kingdcm, which if attained they are no nearer ſatisfaction, then before; and they are ſcarce warm in their places, but death with a daſh with his foot, breaks the pitcher, and ſpoils the ſport, and ſtrips him of that in an hour, that he hath been projecting for all his life: and thus you ſee there is a confuſed hurly-burly in the world, every man dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on his own deſignes, and God all this while tacitly by this, is a carrying on his deſignes, perhaps quite contrary to theirs. Or this tumultuous confuſion amongſt theſe little creatures may reſemble a crowd in a market or fair, ſome ruſh this way, ſome that, that he that ſtands at a diſtance, and obſerves their motion, thinks it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, yet every man is carrying on ſome deſigne or other, and moves accordingly.

Why take you thought for raiment? conſider the lillies of the field, how they grow, they toil not, neither do they ſpin, and yet I ſay unto you, that even</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory is not arayed like one of theſe; wherefore if God ſo clothe the graſs of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven, ſhall he not much more clothe ye?

               <p>WHen I beheld a knot of herbs, mixt with flowers in the garden, in a decaying, withering conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome part dead, others languiſhing; and but a few alive and flouriſhing, I left off weeding, dreſſing, cutting and manuring them, as thoſe that never were likely to anſwer my pains, or recompence my labour, but conſidering there were ſome living which were likely to be choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with weeds if let alone, and diſregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; I tranſplanted them into better ſoil, leaving the dead ones to themſelves for the fire, or any other uſe, I mattered them not: I conſidered then how gaſtly, and unſeemly the place was, when the living herbs were removed, what a confuſed heap, and worthleſs piece it was, of no profit,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40421:77"/> pleaſure, or benefit; the thoughts of this ſtrait brought to my minde, that as I had dealt with theſe withering herbs, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo God oftentimes doth by a wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church, ſome of them he takes into his boſome, others he tranſplants, and findes them a better place, and then roots up the reſt, or reſerves them for the fire, or ſome other judgement; perhaps lets them alone a while to bear a place, and perhaps the name of flowers, till at laſt they are rotten-ripe, and fit for nothing but burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus he preſerved <hi>Noah</hi> for another plot, which he was about to make, when he deſtroyed the old world, which before was his garden, when the plants were moſt dead: He removed <hi>Lot</hi> into another ſoil, when he rooted up his garden in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> he would not fence a place for ſo few living herbs, but laid it waſte, and burnt it up; he tranſplanted <hi>Abraham</hi> from the place of his nativity, and found room by his providence for <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe poſterity he tranſplanted into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where for a long time they did thrive and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; till in the end overrun with weeds briars and thorns, he tranſplanted <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and caſt the Egyptians, thoſe dead and worthleſs plants, thoſe weeds and thorns into the Red-ſea: and ſince that time hath laid waſte many a garden, which

There is many a man that can ſearch natures garden from end to end, that never could ſearch his own heart; many can try their evidence for

Is the fruits of our ſin become the matter of ſport? this conſideration might work in us a contrary effect, and I think much better; but grant (for no body will deny it) that we have liberty given us to make uſe of this antipathy, for the deſtroying of hurtful creatures, and the enjoying of thoſe that are uſefull, (as theſe now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration)

               <p>WHen I had veiwed the ſpiders web, and ſeriouſly conſidered the end it was made for, which (as I ſaid) ſeemed to me to be principally, if not only to catch flys, and to captivate thoſe little creatures, which otherwiſe were too quick for her; I then obſerved the event, and whether this little fowler could this way be recompenſed for all the pains ſhe had taken: I ſaw upon diligent obſervation, how ſmall flys were taken, and made a prey to their poyſonous enemy, who paid their ranſome with their lives, yet whether they were the food ſhe fed upon, or whether it were an innate antipathy in her to them, that thus ſhe ſought their deſtruction, I was not well able to diſcern; but withall I obſerved, that the great flys brake through the net, and ſometimes bare away both the weaver, and the web, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did the gates and poſts of <hi>Gaza,</hi> and ſo the workman and the work were like to periſh together; this minded me of the ſaying of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.15, 16. <hi>the wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands, the heathen are ſunk down into the pit that they made, in the net that they hid is their own foot taken;</hi> I conſidered that many times God by his providence doth thus diſpoſe of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40421:122"/> the cruel enemies of his Church, and thoſe that thirſt after the blood of his Saints, <hi>they have had blood, even their own blood to drink, Rev.</hi> 16.6. ſo righteous is God in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo true in his word; thus it was with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that ſought the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he and his army were overthrown in the Red-ſea: <hi>Adonibezek</hi> that had cauſed <hi>threeſcore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, to gather meat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his table,</hi> was requited in like manner, by the men of <hi>Judah, Judg.</hi> 6.7. thus it was with <hi>Haman,</hi> he procured a decree to cut off a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40421:123"/> not what gentility ſignifies; and he that knows his Maſters will and doth it not, ſhould be beaten with many ſtripes; I have read of a Gentleman being condemned to death, for a flagitious crime, and pleading for a mittigation of his puniſhment becauſe he was a Gentleman, the Judge yielded him but this favour, that he ſhould be hanged upon a higher gallows then the other were; and I fear the Eccleſiaſtical Courts are not much better, perhaps much worſe, poor ones are a prey not worth keeping, great ones are too big to be held, the middle ſort of fiſh beſt ſuits the net, and pleaſeth the palat; oh my ſoul, think not to eſcape at the judgment-ſeat of God, by any external priviledge, <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye,</hi> whether high or low, rich or poor; thou haſt a righteous Judge to be tryed by, that will not be corrupted by gold nor gain, who will hear over again all the cauſes tryed in our Courts of Judicatory, and parhaps paſs another ſentence; if thy cauſe be good, he will not condemn thee; oh my God, abſolve me in thy Court, and no matter if man condemn me, but if thou condemn me, there is none can acquit me.</p>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40421:146"/> of his enemies: if they take away their meat (ſaith the Martyr) God can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their hunger; why not as well as he doth the life of other creatures? and he will do it rather then his promiſe ſhall fail: <hi>Elijah</hi> goes in the ſtrength of one meal forty days, and had God pleaſed, it might have been forty years, for he could have preſerved the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> forty years in the wilderneſs without food as well as with food, from heaven, and as well as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>their garments from waxing old, Deut.</hi> 29.5. <hi>I have led you forty years in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, your cloaths are not waxen old upon you, and thy ſhoe is not waxen old upon thy foot;</hi> they needed not to care <hi>what they ſhould eat, or what they ſhould drink, or wherewithall they ſhould be cloathed;</hi> for God made proviſion of all this, they were maintained at Gods proper coſt and charges; methoughts alſo this ceſſation of action in theſe creatures in winter, did much reſemble ſleep, which if God pleaſed might be as long in other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; and were it not common, would be thought wonderful, and little differing from death it ſelf, and yet experience ſhews us, that which ſeems to deſtroy nature, doth reſtore and refreſh it, or it is like to a ſwoon when the ſymptomes of death are upon a man, yea, in ſome diſtempers the ſymptomes of life for many hours together

As there is no hearb in the garden, but there is ſome counterfeit of it in the field, which reſembles it, ſo there is no grace in the heart of a believer, but the devil hath its counterfeit, and therefore it is a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thing to be a Chriſtian, and an eaſy

               <p>OBſerving a ſnail that ſluggiſh creature, how ſlow ſhe was in her motion, how ſloathfull her pace, how much time was ſpent, how little ground ſhe rid, and obſerving alſo that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations I could uſe, rather hindred then furthered her journey, for when I prickt her forward, ſhe plucks in her horns, and ſtood ſtill, and no means I could uſe could make her mend her pace, this made me think this was a fit embleme of a ſluggard, as he is lively ſet forth by wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> in his book of <hi>Proverbs, the ſlothfull man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaith, there is a lion in the way, I ſhall be ſlain in the ſtreet, Pro.</hi> 26.13, 14. he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the roaring lion that prompts him to theſe ſilly excuſes; but never any came to hell that had not ſome excuſe for their coming thither; corrupt nature needs not be taught to tell her tail, ſin and ſhifting came into the world together; men hide

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40421:176"/> keeping together is the way to be rich, but the holy Ghoſt teacheth us, that it is giving and laying out is the way: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>he that gives to the poor, lends to the Lord, and he will repay him: Pro.</hi> 19.17. <hi>and he that gives to the poor ſhall not lack, Pro.</hi> 28.27. ſo that not getting but giving is the way to wealth; but <hi>he ſhall have judgement without mercy, that will ſhew no mercy: Jam.</hi> 2.13. rich men are Gods ſtewards, he truſts them with his ſtore-houſe, to give their fellow-ſervants their meat in due ſeaſon, and <hi>bleſſed is that ſervant whom his Lord when he comes ſhall finde ſo doing, Mat.</hi> 24.46. but if inſteed of feeding them, they feed themſelves, <hi>and eat and drink with the drunken, and beat their fellow-ſervants, their Lord ſhall come when they are not aware, and ſhall give them their portion with hypocrites, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth:</hi> but all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are too full of ſuch evil ſervants, and ſo is hell too; ſuch duſt-heaps are found in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corner, but thoſe unmercifull men ſhall have their portion with the devil and the damned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. when the charitable Chriſtian ſhall have a portion in glory; we are all Gods ſervants, and have ſome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents or other to improve in his ſervice to his glory, which if we do, we ſhall not be without our reward; <hi>there is none</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhuts the door of my houſe for nought, or kindles a fire upon my altar for nought, Mal.</hi>

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40421:182"/> it is quick and powerful; and wonderfull in operation, whither the fowls of heaven, the elect reſort, in proſperity for ſhadow, in adverſity for defence: In the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, from ſmall beginnings a few poor unlearned fiſhermen, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was carryed as on eagles wings to the end of the earth, and in a ſhort time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued potent princes, that ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, to the admiration of all, thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels came flying with the everlaſting goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and in the reformation, how ſtrangely was it carryed on: <hi>Wickliff, John Hus.</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome of Prague,</hi> theſe paved a way and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a door to <hi>Luther,</hi> who with a few more, withſtood the whole popiſh intereſt, and ſo prevailed againſt them, that thoſe <hi>locuſts that came out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> were never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by their ſmoak to darken the light of the Goſpel again, but it brake forth more and more to the perfect day, even to all mens admiration: in many places it was carryed on againſt their princes conſent, yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his will; in <hi>Holland, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Scotland,</hi> and many more, ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully did this little grain ſpread; and in this Nation by what unexpected means was the Reformation carryed on, by a prince which writ againſt it, and ſet himſelf againſt it; and yet was inſtrumental in Gods hand to carry on the work: God can make uſe of

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40421:185"/> and yet they ſit as unconcerned; but when I conſidered, <hi>Paul may plant, and</hi> Apollo <hi>may water, but it is God that gives the encreaſe,</hi> my wonder ceaſt: man can but ſpeak to the ear, but God ſpeaks to the heart, the ſame fun when it ſhines upon a garden of herbs, makes it ſmell more oderiferouſly, but when it ſhines upon a dunghill it maks it ſmell more fulſomly, the fault is not in the ſun, but in the dunghill, the ſame ſun ſoftens wax, and hardens clay; when the ſun ſhines, and the rain fals upon a fruitful paſture, it makes it more fruitfull, but when upon the heath in the deſart, it is little the better; The reaſon why one bears good fruit, and another bad, under the ſame enjoyment, is, the one is ingrafted into Chriſt another not, but grows upon the ſtock of nature; all the watering, dunging, and manuring in the world will not make a thorn bring forth grapes, or a thiſtle figs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.16. <hi>A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, nor a bad tree good, ſo that the tree is known by his fruit; I am the vine,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and ye are the branches, he that abideth in me, and I in him, ſhall bring forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing; John.</hi> 15.5. A Chriſtian that is grafted into Chriſt, is like the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> fig-tree, that is ſaid to bear fruit ſeven times in the year, or like the lemmon-tree, that ever and anon ſendeth forth new lemmons:
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:40421:185"/> When a man abides in the ſtock of nature, he can bring forth no ſavoury fruit to God; if the fountain be polluted, the ſtreams can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be clear; if the heart be bad, the life cannot be good; if the lungs be infected, the breath will ſtink; of ſuch as theſe, God ſaith, <hi>their vine is the vine of Sodom and of the field of Gomorrha, their grapes are grapes of gall and their cluſters are bitter, Deut.</hi> 32.32. <hi>vitis non vinifera</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>ſed vene infera:</hi> the vine is the evil nature, and the grapes are the wicked works; <hi>they hatch cockatrice-eggs, and weave ſpiders webs, Iſa.</hi> 59.5. But when they are ingrafted in the true vine, they have ſap and nouriſhment from the root, then the buds of good deſires and the bloſſomes of good reſolutions ſpring forth, and after that the fruit of good works; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profeſſors are but like the Ivy that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to, and hath ſome ſhelter and ſupport from the oak, but they ſtand upon their own root, and bear their own fruit; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men are hammering out their own happineſs, and like the ſpider, are climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a thread of their own ſpinning; they live upon themſelves, trade for themſelves, and attribute all to themſelves, and have no higher end then themſelves; for water can aſcend no higher then the fountain head, but all this will fail them, for it is not Chriſt but a gracious ſoul, as it receives ſap and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour

               <p>FRom thoſe ſuckers before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a fruit-bearing tree, I had alſo this following meditation, for obſerving how they grew rank by the nouriſhment that ſhould have fed the tree, and loftily lift up the head above them, and ſuckt that ſap that ſhould have made other branches to bear; and as they were unprofitable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo they rendred the reſt almoſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; I thought they much reſembled ſome new upſtart opinions which ſome unwary profeſſors eſpouſe to themſelves, and becauſe they differ from others, they therefore think themſelves more holy then their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and hold their heads higher, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe growing in opinion, is growing in grace: In <hi>Arragon</hi> there were ſome he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks who called themſelves the <hi>illuminati,</hi> as if they only had been in the light, and all the world beſides had been in darkneſs, the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> would be the only knowing men, the <hi>Manichees</hi> thought whatſoever they taught was food from heaven, and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Love</hi> boaſt of their <hi>Evangelium regni,</hi> and of late the <hi>Ranters</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> boaſt of the infallible conduct of the ſpirit; Now thoſe opinions are ofttimes the brats of their own brain, and many times pernicious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40421:189"/> or at leaſt unprofitable things; or matters of no great concernment, yet they being thus eſpouſed they ſuffer theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſuck all the ſap that ſhould maintain the vitalls of Religion, that the whole tree is thereby rendred uſeleſs and unprofitable: How many are there in our age that might have brought God much glory, and his Church much good, who have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with might and main, and ſpent their time, and their ſtrength, and laid out their zeal, and all for the promoting their own opinion, perhaps an errour, or at beſt but ſome leſſer diſputable truth; perhaps about ſome circumſtance of worſhip, when in the mean time the very fundamentals of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are neglected, and the very vitals lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh for want of nouriſhment, for ſeldome do you ſee a wrangling Chriſtian eminent in the power of godlineſs; Many men when they have eſpouſed an opinion, make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to maintain it, they ſubject not their opinions to the rule, but bring the rule to them, and make it truckle under them, for it is victory and not truth that many ſeek, and therefore they ſpend their time and ſtrength this way, yea, ſhut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that makes not for them; they are as zealous for their opinion, as if the whole of religion conſiſted in it, and as if they could hardly be Chriſtians which were
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40421:190"/> not of their minde, when perhaps for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years they cannot finde a man of their judgement, and all this while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, that the power of godlineſs, and an holy life is the main of religion; for whatever is in the brain, if this be not in the heart, all is worth nothing; theſe mens knowledge floating in the brain, makes them top-heavy, but by reaſon of ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, their knowledge ſinks not down into, nor ſeaſons the heart, or the life: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are like the two men in the fable, that contended about the ſhadow of the aſs they had found, who ſhould go in it in a hot day, till at laſt while they contended, the aſs got looſe, and eſcaped; or like the dog in the fable, that catching at the ſhadow loſt the ſubſtance; ſo theſe contend about trifles, and neglect the main; they are like children that have the rickets, the head grows too big for the body, the head thrives but the whole body pines; they ſpend ſo much of their ſtrength and zeal for externals, that they neglect the internals; they have ſo much zeal for, or againſt ceremonies, that they neglect the ſubſtance; yet miſtake me not, my deſigne is not to make men care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in leſſer points, but more carefull in greater: I would not have them think any ſin ſmall, or to neglect any known duty, but I would have them proportion their
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40421:190"/> zeal according to the weight of the matter, and not ſpend it all upon leſſer matters, and neglect the main concerns: I would have no man neglect his little finger, yet would I have him in the firſt place ſecure his head, and heart; he may be a man, if he want his little finger, but not without his head and his heart; he may be a Chriſtian though he erre about the modes and circumſtances of worſhip, but he cannot without holineſs and ſincerity: ſome Chriſtians are like the <hi>Salamander</hi> always in the fire of contention, but theſe mens graces rather then corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are like to be burnt: I like not thoſe men that moddle religion in their own brain, and make their own conceptions the center of unity; and like <hi>Procruſtes</hi> make his own bed fit all comers; <hi>Let all things</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>be done decently and in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. a neceſſary rule, but ſo extremely wrackt, that I conceive through mens corruption, it hath produced more indecency and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then any one Scripture beſides; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and others making this the foundation of all their needleſs ceremonies: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the point in hand, my deſire and deſigne is to perſwade men to maintain the vitalls of Religion, in the firſt place, and let the ſtrength of their zeal be laid out here, and for leſſer points, if diſputable, let every man be ſatisfied in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:40421:191"/> and grant ſome allowance to others that differ in their judgements, till they themſelves are infallibly ſure that they hold no errors: take Chriſts counſel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1. <hi>judge not that you be not judged, for with what judgement ye judge, ye ſhall be judged, and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again:</hi> many men are quick-ſighted abroad, but blinde at home; reade alſo the Apoſtles counſel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. &amp;c. Oh my ſoul, ſpend not thy time and ſtrength in trifles, when thou haſt other work to do, let thy greateſt zeal be laid out on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greateſt concernment, maintain the vitalls of religion, and that will maintain thee; do not doat upon the brats of thy own brain, neither cenſure thoſe that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thee in cicumſtantials; love Chriſt whereever thou ſee him, though in one of another judgement; Lord, make me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the main, and to employ and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all my ſtrength for thee.</p>

               <p>WHen I conſidered the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned tree, that made ſuch a pompous and promiſing ſhew, and was grown top-heavy, and yet fruitleſs and worthleſs, when many ſmaller ſhrubs yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a plentiful encreaſe: I conſidered it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and obſerved this was not all, for I plainly ſaw that it was an enemy to all that grew near it, and none proſpered about it; for in overſhaddowing them or dropping upon them, it rendred all that were within the reach of it either barren or at leaſt not ſo fruitful, as thoſe that grew at a greater diſtance: This Obſervation helpt me to the following Meditation: I thought this tree did much reſemble many great men, which make a pompous ſhew, and make a great coil, and keep a great ſtir, and buſtle in the world, and yet bear little or no good fruit,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:40421:194"/> but it is bitter, ſowr or unſavory; they ſpread abroad their branches far wide, fill a countrey, have many under them, that might bear much fruit, but they drop ſuch a poyſonful influence upon them, that they neither bear no fruit, or worſe then none, bad fruit; for they can ſeldome proſper, or bring any good fruit to maturity, neither is there any good tree or flower can live near them; we may ſay of them, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe that live under them, as God doth of the like, <hi>Deu.</hi> 32.32. &amp;c. <hi>their vine is the vine of</hi> Sodom, <hi>and of the fields of</hi> Gomorrha; <hi>their grapes are grapes of gall, and their cluſters are bitter, their wine is the poyſon of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and the cruel venom of aſps:</hi> for what can you obſerve from many great ones, and thoſe that depend upon them, but ſwearing, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gluttony, adultery, Sabbath-breaking, oppreſſing, perſecuting, and an enmity of the power of godlineſs, and there ſhall not a godly man live under them, nor within their reach, if they can help it, and they do ſo poyſon all about them, that the very earth it ſelf is curſed for their ſakes, and by their means toads and ſerpents, brambles and briars, thoſe fruits of the curſe, can only proſper near them, and harbour under their ſhadow; and yet alaſs, ſtill they are but men, though great men, and ſignify no more then men, and like men they ſhall die, and

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:40421:196"/> theſe are the <hi>trees planted by the rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that bring forth their fruit in their ſeaſon, Pſal.</hi> 1.3. for as ancient men, ſo eſpecially ancient Chriſtians have their judgement ripened by their experience, and mellowed by time, others may be, and uſually are more heady, raſh and ſenſorious, and have a more hot, and burning zeal, but it is not according to knowledge; now zeal without knowledge (as one ſaith) is like mettle in a blinde horſe, which ofttimes ſerves but to break his own or the riders neck, their zeal is like that of the Apoſtles, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John, Luk.</hi> 9.54. who would have called for fire from heaven to conſume the inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, but this wilde fire was never kindled on Gods hearth, as <hi>Elijahs</hi> was; this became not a goſpel frame of ſpirit; but this younger fruit is not ſo pleaſant to the taſte; we may ſay of this, as Chriſt ſpeaks of wine, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.39. no man having drunk old wine, preſently deſireth new, for (ſaith he) the old is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Now as age clarifies wine and ripens it, ſo doth experience ripen mens judgements, young profeſſors make a great noiſe, and a great ſhew in the world, they bud and bloom, and many of them bring forth fruit, yet is not their fruit ſo pleaſant till it be ripened by age, and mellowed by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; they are more heady (as I ſaid)
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:40421:197"/> and ſenſorious, and apt to condemn thoſe that cannot ſee with their eyes, that differ from them, though it be in circumſtantials and things of ſmall concerns; yea perhaps diſrobe them of their graces, as if their hearts liks <hi>Jehu</hi>'s were the touchſtone of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and their judgement the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of truth; but ancient Chriſtians have learnt Chriſt better, and ſtudied their own hearts more, and will yield a grain of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to others, as knowing they need it themſelves, and where they ſee the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion preſerved, they will reach out the right hand of fellowſhip, though it be to men of a contrary perſwaſion in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer matters; yea, they will love thoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and value them more then they do thoſe of their own perſwaſion, where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee ſuch evident ſignes of grace, but many times in young profeſſors a little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about circumſtantialls caſts ſuch a miſt before their eyes, that they cannot ſee any grace at all in their antagoniſts: a grown Chriſtian owns Chriſt whereever he ſees him, yea, though it be in one that hath wronged him, and he verily thinks hates him, or though it be in one that ſtands in his light, or in his way to preferment; there is honourable mention made of an old diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>Acts.</hi> 21.16. a gray-headed experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Chriſtian, a father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. <hi>you

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:40421:206"/> more unwilling they ſhould break priſon then others, and hangs more fetters and irons upon them: great Commanders are more narrowly watcht if they are priſoners, and more dearly ranſomed then private ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: hence it was, that <hi>Elymas</hi> the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer, by the devils inſtigation, ſought to turn away <hi>Surgius Paulus the deputy from the faith; Act.</hi> 13.8. as knowing he was like to be a leading man which way ever he took: If great men have but leaves, they are invyed for the leaves ſake, and few of them ever bring forth fruit to maturity, yea, the leaves themſelves, their very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are oft times born down by the ſtorm; I have ſeen ſome that I verily believed were well rooted and grounded, who yet upon approaching ſtorms have truckled under them, have hid their religion, diſſembled their profeſſion, and ſtole away from their colours, and all for fear of leaving, or loſing any part of their eſtates; This hath given me occaſion ſometimes to bleſs God, that hath freed me from ſome of thoſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that others lie under, and hath given me <hi>Agars</hi> petition, <hi>neither poverty nor riches, but food convenient,</hi> and hath kept me almoſt all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40421:229"/> ſtomack ſpoils all the ſport, and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light vaniſhed; and although I purpoſely propounded ſeveral delightful objects to my ſelf to divert my thoughts, yet nothing would do it, no meditation would faſten, no thoughts fix in my minde, but the thought of meat: This put me in minde of the fable of <hi>Midas,</hi> that when he had gotten liberty of the Gods, to wiſh what he would, with a promiſe that it ſhould be granted, wiſht that all he toucht ſhould be turned to gold; which was immediatly done, but when he came to eat and to drink, his meat and drink turned to gold alſo, and ſo loſt its nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive vertue, and ſo in the midſt of his riches he was reduced to the greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and ready to periſh for want of food, and became more miſerable then the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt beggar: I thought with my ſelf if that which is fabled of him were verifyed of me, that I were able my ſelf with my touch to turn all thoſe herbs and flowers, graſs, and trees into gold, yea, the ground I trod up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all that I did either ſee, or feel, how little ſatisfaction would this bring me without meat? one meals meat would bring me more content in my need, then all this, for this would prove but a rich famiſhment; oh vain man how apt art thou to thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which can do thee no good, for this life, nor that to come, and canſt not
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:40421:230"/> thou content thy ſelf without it, though thou haſt that which is far better? oh bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gold, with what charms doſt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate the minds of men, to doat after thee; when thou canſt never ſatisfy the minde or ſtomack? yet art thou become the price of bloud, yea, the price of ſouls, and many a man ſells his ſoul to the devil for thee, to live in endleſs, eaſeleſs, and remedileſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I found by experience that had I had all the wealth in the world, and all the gold in the <hi>Indies</hi> in exchange for my meat, my condition would have been worſe then it is, yea, worſe then the pooreſt beggar that goes from door to door, yea, then that of the gally-ſlaves in <hi>Turky,</hi> and one meals meat would do me more good then all this: this minded me of Gods goodneſs, and mans unthankfulneſs, he gives us what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and ſatisfactory, we thirſt after that which is neither neceſſary nor ſatisfactory: From this Conſideration my meditation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a little higher, and I began to think that food was as neceſſary ſor the ſoul as for the body, for where life is, there muſt be food to maintain it, and ſpiritual life requires ſpiritual food: I began to conſider whether ever I was ſo ſenſible of the want of ſpiritual food as I was of temporal; and found by experience how vain earthly delights were, and how unſatisfactory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:40421:230"/> food; but oh how little, yea, too little ſenſible I am of the want of ſpiritual food; how little appetite have I to that bread which came down from heaven, and that <hi>ſincere milk of the word,</hi> that heavenly <hi>mannah</hi> which is daily ſpread about our tents: this made me alſo conſider, how it is with a poor hungring, thirſting, panting ſoul after Chriſt, that crys out, give me Chriſt or elſe I die, and it is no wonder, that nothing but Chriſt can ſatisfy ſuch a hunger-ſtarved ſoul, for if neither ſweet ſmels, pleaſant ſights, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful muſick, nor any earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay, gold it ſelf, the quinteſcence (as many imagine) of all earthly happineſs, can ſatisfy an hungry man without meat, or a thirſty man without drink, ſurely then neither riches nor honours, pleaſures, nor preferments can ſatisfy an hungry ſoul without Chriſt; for though the devil ſtill many that cry for Chriſt, with the world, as a nurſe doth a childe that crys for gold with a counter, yet where there is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the worth of Chriſt, and the want of Chriſt, where there hath been a taſte of Chriſt, he cannot thus delude them: an hungry man is not ſatisfied with a cake of clay, nor an hungry ſoul with a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bible: oh my ſoul, how is it with thee? didſt thou ever thus hunger, thus thirſt after Chriſt? and nothing will ſatisfy but

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:40421:234" rendition="simple:additions"/> and were like to be my bed-fellows, if I lodged there, and bats and owls, thoſe birds of the night, were my companions; this made me to conſider, how unpleaſant this place of delights, the greateſt recreation I had in the world for my body, would be to me at this time, had I no other habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how unpleaſant the night would be to me: here I lay open to winde and weather, liable to be wet with the dew of heaven, and was like to have the air for my ſupper, and with <hi>Jacob</hi> a ſtone for my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; I conſidered now, though I too often forget it, the great goodneſs of God to the <hi>juſt and to the unjuſt,</hi> to cauſe his ſun to ſhine upon them, one ſun makes a day, but the moon and all the ſtars make but a night, but what a mercy is it then, when the <hi>ſun of righteouſneſs ariſeth with healing in his wings?</hi> The unpleaſantneſs of the preſent ſeaſon to me, made me pitty many poor creatures that are neceſſarily expoſed to theſe, and worſe then theſe hardſhips, as ſouldiers lodging in the fields, yea, many wandring people that in the winter-ſeaſon ſuffer much, as for thoſe that deſignedly endure this life, rather then expoſe themſelves to labour, are not to be pittied, correction is a fitter ſalve for their ſore: but there are many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and impotent, lame, and unable, that ſhould be better cared for, and I fear God
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:40421:234" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath a controverſy with the nation upon this account; this conſideration driven up to the head, made me bleſs God this was not my condition, and to fear leſt my ſins and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs might provoke God to make it my condition: This raiſed my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little higher, and I thought with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if this garden, this place of delights be no comfortable abiding-place for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy when night comes, ſure then the world is no reſting-place for the ſoul, for death will come: here in the day-time of life man may take ſome delight, <hi>but the night will come when no man can work,</hi> and when all theſe things ſhall vaniſh, I muſt ſeek out for ſome better ſhelter, ſome better lodging, ſome better reſting-place for my ſoul: when night comes, and the ſun is ſet upon me, all theſe delightful objects will be gone, will forſake me, and hide their heads, and they will yeeld no delight, no comfort or refreſhment; crowns and kingdoms, dirt and dung, will then be valued alike, and a piece of lead will be as good as a piece of gold, or an heap of diamonds; theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things can afford neither food nor phyſick, neither lodging nor entertainment, neither pleaſures nor profit, to the weary ſoul; theſe earthly tabernacles ere long will be diſſolved, and theſe houſes of clay, will moulder into duſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. and what

               <p>IN a rainy and very tempeſtuous day, being driven into the houſe by the violence of the ſtorm, and the tempeſt proving ſo violent &amp; furious, that the houſe it ſelf could hardly ſecure me from the fury of it: This made me conſider what a mercy it was in ſuch a ſeaſon to have a retiring place for ſhelter, and how uncomfortable it would have been to me, had I been forc't to have born the brunt of this raging ſtorm, and yet how
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:40421:238"/> little do we value theſe mercyes when we know not the want of them, and how few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn praiſe to God that hath given us <hi>houſes that we builded not, and vineyards that we planted not. Deu.</hi> 6.11. ſaturity oft breeds ſecurity, and fulneſs forgetfulneſs, the moon at the full is furtheſt from the ſun, and ofttimes ſuffers ecclips by the interpoſition of the earth, and ſo we are ofttimes like <hi>Jeſurun that waxed fat and kicked,</hi> or like full-fed hawks, that will not know their maſter; neither do we pitty thoſe that want houſes, or whoſe houſes at leaſt are not able to ſecure them, or keep them dry; this put me in minde to bleſs my God that had made ſuch a comfortable proviſion for me, that I ſeldom ſuffered upon this account, and to condole thoſe whoſe condition was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I conſidered how great a mercy rain and waters were, that neither man, nor beaſt, nor tree, nor plant, that neither the rational, the ſenſitive, nor vegetative creature, could ſubſiſt, or live without it, and how dear and precious it was to the Patriarks of old, and in many places of the world at this day; how ſcarce it was with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yea, was, and in many places is their conſtant, if not only drink, and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have periſhed for want of it, and how it would be prized of us did we want it; yea, how often when the ſhowers of heaven are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, do our fields languiſh, and the fruits
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:40421:238"/> of the earth fail, and yet who is it that is thankful, when God gives us <hi>the former and the latter rain in its ſeaſon?</hi> and yet how much are we engaged to God, in <hi>England</hi> above ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places? we ſeldom are reduced to ſuch ſtraits as others are, for want of water, but have abundance of freſh rivers, brooks, and torrents, yea, ſprings and ponds in moſt parts of the land, that man nor beaſt ſeldome want it; how would ſuch a mercy be prized in many places of the world? and yet though water be ſuch a mercy, when it is abuſed God can turn it into a judgement: he drowned the old world with it, and overwhelmed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the Red Sea, and many times in thoſe Northern climats, he puniſhes us with immoderate rain, and ſhowers, which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proves the cauſe of ſcarcity and want, thereby teaching us, that the greateſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings, if abuſed, may be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to curſes, and <hi>a fruitful land made barren for the wickedneſs of thoſe that dwell therein, Pſal.</hi> 107.34. Having ſpent ſome time on theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſtorm continuing, the preſent provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence brought to my minde the words of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Pro.</hi> 19.13. <hi>a fooliſh ſon is the calamity of his father, and the contentions of a wife are a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dropping, Pro.</hi> 27.15. <hi>a continual dropping in a very rainy day, and a contentious woman are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:</hi> &amp;c. this is like a tempeſt in the heaven, moſt troubleſome, and moſt dangerous; when
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:40421:239"/> a man comes home tired, with his labour and travail, and expects refreſhing at his own houſe, and there is entertained, either with the continual dropping of rain upon his head, or with an unbridled ſcolding tongue of an unreaſonable wife, both are troubleſome, both are uncomfortable, a croſs grained contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous yoak-fellow, whether man or woman, ſowers all the comforts of life, and renders that relation the moſt troubleſome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable of any in the world, which would otherwiſe be the ſweeteſt and moſt delightful of all others: hence ſaith <hi>Solomon, it is better live in a corner on the houſe-top, then with a braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling woman in a wide houſe, Pro.</hi> 21.19. a man had better abide abroad expoſed to winde and weather, or crib himſelf up in any little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or corner, then live with a contentious woman, that is ever brawling and brangling, for ſuch turn <hi>conjugium</hi> into <hi>conjurgium, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> into <hi>mar-age,</hi> and inſtead of love and amity they promote ſtrife and emnity, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply curſes inſtead of prayers; The marriage-relation is the moſt deſirable, or the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, of all others; none is more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful where love and unity is, none is more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful where ſtrife and contention, envy and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred bears the ſway; and as family-peace is a deſirable bleſſing, and family-jars an unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable torment, ſo peace among neighbours is a mercy, and the contrary a ſore judgement;
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:40421:239"/> but many like the <hi>Salamander</hi> live in the fire, they love to foment jars and contentions, and are never ſo well, as when they are ſowing diſcord, or working miſchief, <hi>Pro.</hi> 26.21. <hi>as coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, ſo is a contentious man to kindle ſtrife;</hi> many men are like mad dogs, they ſnarl at all, and would if they could bite all, and make them as mad as themſelves, ſome contentious Chriſtians alſo there are that in this fire burn and conſume their graces, not their vices; theſe grow in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and flouriſh with theſe leaves, ſeldome in grace, for their fruit is ſeldom ſeen, or it is bitter and unſavoury; they are ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roab all others of their graces that attain not to the ſame pitch of opinion with themſelves, but the Church is little beholding to them, whoſe zeal ſets all into a combuſtion; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all peace, peace with God, and peace with a mans conſcience is moſt to be deſired, yea, abſolutely neecſſary, which cannot be had, till we break our peace with ſin, and ſatan: oh my ſoul, ſtudy peace with all men, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, without which you ſhall never ſee God; ſtudy peace with thy relations, but eſpecially with thy God; and if thy ways pleaſe him, thy enemy ſhall be at peace with thee: oh my God, let not the devil by his wiles nor the world by her frowns or ſmiles make me break my peace with thee.</p>

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:40421:241"/> on the one ſide, diſcovered to me what inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and wrongs, what hardſhip and miſeries poor creatures may be expoſed to; how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain theſe tranſitory enjoyments are, and how ſoon they may be loſt, and for ought I know this may be my own condition, how ſoon I know not, and what would I then give to be in ſuch a condition that I now am, although it be not altogether free from ſome troubles and hardſhip? it minded me alſo on the other ſide, of the cruelty of bloud-thirſty enemies, and what we may expect from them, if ever we fall into their hands, or lie at their mercy; and this made me admire Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this nation in general, and to my ſelf in particular, that it is ſo well with us as it is, yea this conſideration made me more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my condition then before, and to bleſs God that he had made ſuch plentiful proviſion for me, that had deſerved ſo little at his hands; when he ſuffered thoſe Worthys of whom the world was not worthy, to have triall of <hi>cruell mockings and ſcourgings, yea, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of bonds and impriſonments, they were ſtoned, ſawn in ſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword, they wandred about in ſheep-skins, and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of whom the world was not worthy, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in deſarts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth, Heb.</hi> 11.36.
